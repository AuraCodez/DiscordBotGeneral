This is my Discord Bot that I created. This bot is designed to provide a range of useful features to optimize and enhance your Discord server experience.

Some of the current features of the Discord Bot include:

    - Tracking the number of times users have cursed in the server
    - Deletes Curse Words immediately when a user has said it
    - Greeting users as they enter the server
    - Generating random quotes and facts from the usage of a restful api

Future Features

    - Security-related commands, such as the ability to kick and mute users
    - Additional customization options, such as the ability to set a custom greeting message
    - Using a database to keep track of swear count so that it doesn't reset after the discord bot has been turned off.
