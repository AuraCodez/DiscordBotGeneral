# DiscordBotGeneral

A very useful discord bot that has a bunch of commands to make your Discord Server more optimized. 
Some features include
- Keeping track of how many times has cursed
- Greeting the user when they enter the server
- Generate random quotes, and facts.

I am looking to add more features to the bot in the future. Mainly things to do with security of the server, such as kicking, muting, etc.
