# The Really Useful Discord Bot

Technologies Used : Python and Discord.py Library

## Description

This is my Discord Bot that I created. This bot is designed to provide a range of useful features to optimize and enhance your Discord server experience. 

Some of the current features of the Discord Bot include:

    - Tracking the number of times users have cursed in the server
    - Deletes Curse Words immediately when a user has said it
    - Greeting users as they enter the server
    - Generating random quotes and facts from the usage of a RestFUL api
    
    
I am currently working on:

    - Implementing SQLite to keep track of the swear count that each user has, as long as storing what swear word they said
    - Keeping the Discord Bot Running 24/7
    - Making it fetch data from Reddit about news about finance, technology, etc.
